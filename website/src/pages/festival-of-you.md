  Urban Outfitters have been continually criticised for their negative influence
  on the self-esteem and confidence in young people, especially young girls.
  'Festival of You' is a concept designed to alter the brand's damaged
  reputation. The event offers customers a 2 day celebration of themselves and a
  chance to improve their confidence through a series of inspirational talks and
  workshops.
