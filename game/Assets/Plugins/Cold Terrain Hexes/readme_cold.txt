Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D terrain hex tiles of cold and snow-covered land suitable for an overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 
- due to popular demand, adapted to hex tiles from my set of painted square terrain tiles
- 13 tile types x 4 variations + 11 additional location tiles = 63 tiles total 
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees, hills, and mountains can overlap the tiles behind 

Terrain types included: 
- snow-covered mountains (+ 4 variants with caves) 
- snowfields
- forest (pine, snow transition, snow-covered + clearing location for each type)
- rocky hills (bare, snow transition, snow-covered + cave location for each type)
- cold plains (bare, snow transition, snow-covered + pond location for each type)
- ocean with icebergs
- cold dirt

Do note that this does not actually require Unity 5.2 or higher, you can use it in pretty much any application. This is a tilesheet saved as a png and split and named into sprites. There are also the individual tiles in a separate folder if that's how you roll.

Usage:
These hexagonal terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out and over the tiles 'behind' them.

Future:
If these prove popular, I may wish to do further hexes to add to this set, and further types of tilesets like this. I do have a passion for terrain tiles, after all. So drop me a line if you've got something particular in mind.
